## My Self-Assessment

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My time in the computer science program at SNHU has helped me to develop and showcase my technical strengths while shaping my professional goals and values. My journey with SNHU has helped me to hone my skills while encouraging an appetite for constant learning and growth. Working on code reviews and artifact enhancements, and the necessary reflection that comes with these tasks, has taught me the importance of clean, industry-standard code, adapting to feedback, and constantly striving for improvement. By reflecting on past work, I can see both how I’ve grown into an asset for potential employers and how I can continue to grow and improve.

Importantly, my courses emphasized teamwork and communication. I’ve gained experience collaborating in a team environment while communicating clearly and respectfully by participating in group projects and discussions. CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle gave me valuable experience with agile roles and communication with members of my team, stakeholders, and product owners. This course also focused on requirement elicitation, which taught me the importance of documentation, responsive communication, and creative problem solving. The ability to demonstrate project progress to both technical and non-technical audiences is another crucial skill that contributes to my ability to communicate clearly with diverse audiences and carefully consider other perspectives.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My studies have also given me solid foundations in data structures and algorithms. In courses like CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design I was introduced to linked lists, hash tables, binary search trees, sorting algorithms, and more. Becoming familiar with these data structures and algorithms was key to understanding the importance of data organization and efficiency in software. These projects sharpened my algorithmic problem-solving skills, and this ePortfolio includes artifacts that demonstrate those techniques.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collectively, the artifacts and documentation in this portfolio demonstrate achievement of the program’s core outcomes. Through projects that required iterative development, code review, and enhancement, I employed strategies for building collaborative environments that support organizational decision making, reflecting real-world team dynamics and stakeholder input. The portfolio itself, through clear documentation and structured narratives, illustrates my ability to design, develop, and deliver professional-quality communications that are technically sound and tailored to a diverse audience. Each artifact showcases my capacity to design and evaluate computing solutions using established algorithmic principles and computer science standards, while managing trade-offs related to performance, scalability, maintainability, and usability. Additionally, the projects highlight my use of well-founded and innovative tools, techniques, and development practices to implement solutions that deliver measurable value and align with industry expectations. Finally, considerations with each enhancement demonstrate a security-first mindset that anticipates potential exploits and identifies vulnerabilities in software design while applying mitigation strategies to protect data and system integrity. This portfolio presents a cohesive body of work that reflects my readiness to contribute as thoughtful, adaptable, and security-conscious computer science professional.
